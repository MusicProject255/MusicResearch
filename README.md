### Presentation to-do
1. Issue reports with current data - what works and what doesn't?
2. Short "mission statement," and what we are going to do to achieve our goal.
3. Detail of *exact* graphs and what they represent.
4. State what purpose we all serve in the group (make a chart)
5. Finish by compiling 1-4 into a powerpoint and practice presenting.
